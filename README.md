# ProgDA-Project-SDS
Project 2020 - Programming for Data Analysis

#### Project Objective:

The objectives of this project are as follows:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesize/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook

#### Contents of the repository

The contents of this repository are as follows:

1. .gitignore
2. LICENCE
3. Readme.md (this file)
4. ProgDA-Project-SDS.ipynb
5. dly532.csv - Weather related data to generate the temperature variable

#### Running the program

The program is contained within the Jupyter notebook 'ProgDA-Project-SDS.ipynb' which is the main file in the repository.

To open and run the file:

* Open the file in Jupyter notebooks
* Run the 'import' modules cell first

All documentation is contained within the workbook itself and so has not been reproduced here.

#### Displaying the dataset:

The dataset is displayed by running the code blocks in Steps 1 through 5 of the notebook and calling 'df' variable which holds the pandas DataFrame.

#### Limitations:

As the Notebook uses the Numpy random module, the data within will change slightly on each running of the workbook. Therefore the commentary within may be based on the data generated while making the workbook. The theory and concepts within the workbook still apply.
