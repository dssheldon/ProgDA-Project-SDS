    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook"

    ">Building Energy Rating (BER) certificates were introduced in Ireland in 2007, as required under the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. The purpose of a BER is to make the energy performance of a dwelling visible and comparable to other dwellings on a like for like basis, allowing buyers and tenants to consider energy performance when deciding to purchase or rent a building. To do this the BER rates the theoretical energy performance of a dwelling, assigning it a rating from A1-G based on a calculation of the primary energy consumption in kWh per metre squared per year under standard conditions. Therefore a BER is similar to the energy rating on appliances, with A rated homes being the most energy efficient (and likely to have lower energy bills) and G rated homes being the least energy-efficient. The most efficient rating is an “A1” rating, which represents annual energy consumption of less than 25 kWh/m2., as illustrated in the table below:\n",
